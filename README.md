This code presents a novel physical-layer
security (PLS) scheme for the underlay multiple-input multiple-
output (MIMO) D2D communications in the presence of multiple
eavesdroppers. The proposed new PLS scheme can significantly
reduce the information leakage for both CUs and DUs by adopt-
ing a null steering scheme at the transmitter. A signal alignment
technique is also employed to eradicate the stringent requirement
of a larger number of transmitter antennas than that of the
receiver antennas. A generalized nonlinear optimization problem
has been formulated to improve the PLS performance for MIMO-
D2D communications. A closed-form and generalized analytical
expression of the secrecy outage probability for CUs and DUs
is derived over the imperfect Nakagami-m and Norton fading
channels. Theoretical and simulation results of our proposed new
PLS scheme have shown significant improvement in the secrecy
capacity and secrecy outage probability for both CUs and DUs
in comparison with the existing methods.
